# CommuteCast
A web app to provide weather forecasts along a traveled route.

## How it works
Simply pick a day and input a Start and Destination. The app will draw up your distance vector and plot the weather along various points of the route. To get more detailed info on the weather at any point, hover over (or tap if on mobile) any weather icon.
